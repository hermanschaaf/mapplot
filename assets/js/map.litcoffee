This is written in literate coffeescript!

First we define some global variables. `map` is the Google map object we will create shortly. We define a starting point for our map, which is currently set to Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. The maxTime is the longest amount of time, in minutes, we are going to show the user where she can go.
    
    map = undefined
    startingPoint = new google.maps.LatLng(35.658482, 139.651376)
    maxTime = 30

`circleDrawing` is where we will store the final array of paths that are to be cut out of the `everythingElse` earth-covering polygon. We will have to do a union of all the circles we want to draw to make it look right, but more on that later.

    circleDrawing = null
    circles = []
    pointsOfInterest = []
    bounds = null

We need a polygon to cover the entire service of the earth, so that we can cut holes into that to show where the user is able to go within a certain amount of time. To this end, we define a triangle that stretches from latitude -87 to the 3 corners of the Google Maps earth. Interestingly, using a rectangle here simply results in a line that runs from North to South along the 180Â° line!

    everythingElse = [
      new google.maps.LatLng(-87, 120), 
      new google.maps.LatLng(-87, -87),
